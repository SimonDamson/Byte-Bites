📌 Improvements Made in the Website

When the project started, the business had only a basic idea of what they wanted online (subscriptions, diet quiz, payments).
We improved and developed it into a functional website with:

1. Design & Branding

Bright pastel color scheme (mint green, peach, white) for a friendly, modern look.

Rounded typography and clean layout for better readability.

Mobile-first responsive design so the site works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

2. New Features Added

✅ Smart Quiz – A gamified nutrition quiz with images, making it more engaging.
✅ Subscription Plans & Checkout – Clear pricing and Stripe-ready payment integration.
✅ Blog Section – To promote healthy snacking with articles and content.
✅ Contact & FAQ Pages – To help build trust and handle customer queries.
✅ Navigation Improvements – Added a hamburger menu for small screens.
✅ Scroll-to-Top Button – Improves usability for long pages.

3. User Experience (UX) Enhancements

Streamlined checkout with fewer clicks.

Visual quiz with food pictures for interactive engagement.

Consistent color-coded buttons for calls-to-action (e.g., subscribe, checkout).

Clear structure: Homepage → Quiz → Plans → Checkout.

4. Recent updates

Embedded Map: I added an embedded map to the Contact page, making it easier for visitors to find my business location.

Form Validation: I implemented form validation for the Enquiry and Contact forms, ensuring that users can't submit empty forms.

Gallery Lightbox: A gallery lightbox has been added, enhancing the user’s experience when viewing images.

Meta Tags: I added meta tags for description and keywords, improving search engine optimization (SEO).

Smart Quiz Button: The "Take the Smart Quiz" button now links to the Smart Quiz page.

Readme File Updates: I updated the README file to include improvements, changelog, commits, GitHub link, and references.
