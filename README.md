When the project started, the business had only a basic idea of what they wanted online (subscriptions, diet quiz, payments).
We improved and developed it into a functional website with:

Bright pastel color scheme (mint green, peach, white) for a friendly, modern look.

Rounded typography and clean layout for better readability.

Mobile-first responsive design so the site works on phones, tablets, and desktops.

2. New Features Added

âœ… Smart Quiz â€“ A gamified nutrition quiz with images, making it more engaging.
âœ… Subscription Plans & Checkout â€“ Clear pricing and Stripe-ready payment integration.
âœ… Blog Section â€“ To promote healthy snacking with articles and content.
âœ… Contact & FAQ Pages â€“ To help build trust and handle customer queries.
âœ… Navigation Improvements â€“ Added a hamburger menu for small screens.
